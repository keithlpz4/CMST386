<!--I implement SASS via a VScode extension called Live Sass Compiler by Ritwek Dey. The extension allowed me to create a SASS subfolder within my project and watch the .SCSS file to automatically build and update my .CSS file instantly see changes implemented in my HTML file. i took advantage of SASS nested capabilities to reduce the amount of repeated code i was creating.-->

                <h3>Importance of Responsive Design</h3>
                <p>
                    There is no guarantee how a user will access and view a website, it be for personal accessibility setting or the restrictions of a device. Responsive design allows web developers the ability to control they users view content by enabling developers to adapt the web site to account for these personal settings. For example, the navigation bar can be collapsed, hidden, and set completely as a drop menu to allow mobile cellphone users ability to read content easier as they do not have the access to 24‚Äù monitor.

                <h3>Google Analytics: 3 different types of reports</h3>
                <p>
                    Data analytics have become a big part of the internet as it allows companies and website owners the ability to see if their websites are doing well and how. Google Analytics is a tool that offers data capture tools such as:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Audience Report grants developers to determine the level user enthusiasm of a site or app by tracking active users, understand the age-and-gender of their audiences and track where the language and region the web traffic is coming from. This allows the site owner to tailor and market their content appropriately (Advertising reports - Analytics Help).</li>
                        <li>Behavior Flow Reports allows developers to track how users move around your website. This report allows developers to discover what content keeps users engaged, see users navigate thru the content as expected and how various marketing channels are sending traffic to the website (About the flow visualization reports - Analytics Help).</li>
                        <li>Acquisition report Reports are reports that show web owners which sources send the highest quality traffic and conversions (Google Analytics, 2017). This shows how the user visited your site by capturing the medium, source and market campaign. This allows developers to understand which marketing technique is most effective in getting users to visit their site.</li>
                    </ul>
