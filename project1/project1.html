                <h3>Describe how search engines work.</h3>
                <p>Search engines perform search queries using three core functions: crawling, indexing, and ranking.
                    Crawlers search for information based on the search query. Once a crawler has identified a webpage a
                    copy of it is returned to the data center to be indexed. Afterwards the search engine ranks indexed
                    webpages based on relevancy and return the results to the user (Dopinger, 2021).</p>

                <h3>Explain the importance of keywords and descriptions as meta tags.</h3>
                <p>Meta tags are unseen descriptors about an HTML page that search engines utilize to identify websites.
                    These descriptors can provide relevant information to crawlers by giving a summary of the content
                    available on the website or page and technology able to view the page (Morris, 2019). For the
                    viewport meta tag that describe how a page should be viewed on mobile devices or screen sizes. This
                    will be ranked higher in the search engine database as mobile sites granted better accessibility to
                    users (Kang, 2020).</p>

                <h3>List the four elements that comprise writing relevant content links.</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Come from topically relevant sources – earn links from relevant sources. For instance, try to
                        earn a link for a bike store and not a music store, if your site is about discusses bicycles
                    </li>
                    <li>Bring qualified traffic to your site – create links that are useful to users, not search engines
                    </li>
                    <li>Use relevant, natural anchor text – avoid repetitive anchor text that genuinely relates to the
                        content of your website.</li>
                    <li>Be strategically targeted and naturally earned – do not automatically give links to other sites
                        without careful consideration about the other sites content and how it relates to your site.
                    </li>

                <h3>What constitutes good heading hierarchy and include an example with more than one heading tag.</h3>
                <p> Good heading hierarchy is useful to both users and search engines. Users cab quickly scan a page
                    using its headings to determine if the site will be relevant to them whereas search engines utilize
                    heading to understand the pages’ structure (Vessum &amp; Zach, 2021).</p>
